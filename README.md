# IGLIGEN: Improved Implementation for Training GLIGEN (Open-Set Grounded Text-to-Image Generation)
This research project aims to create a complete, huggingface-style pipeline for **training** GLIGEN adapters. The project is part of the effort in creating [LLM-grounded Diffusion Models (LMD+)](https://llm-grounded-diffusion.github.io/) and [LLM-grounded Video Diffusion Models (LVD-GLIGEN)](https://llm-grounded-video-diffusion.github.io/). **This implementation supports SD v1.4/v1.5, SD v2.0/v2.1, and ModelScope (grounded text-to-video generation), with SDXL support planned.** You can use/download pretrained GLIGEN adapters [here](#pretrained-gligen-adapters).

## Motivation
The official [GLIGEN](https://github.com/gligen/GLIGEN) training code is from the original latent diffusion/stable diffusion codebase. This make  it not fully compatible with huggingface `diffusers`, `transformers`, `datasets`, and `accelerate` that are commonly used for training diffusion models. Currently, the only released gligen weights are on SDv1.4, and weights for more updated models such as SDv2.1 are missing. This repo (IGLIGEN) makes training GLIGEN on custom datasets and custom models easier.

## Pretrained GLIGEN adapters
### Text-to-video generation
The pretrained adapters for text-to-video generation on ModelScope can be found here: [https://huggingface.co/longlian/text-to-video-lvd-ms](https://huggingface.co/longlian/text-to-video-lvd-ms). You can use LLM-generated dynamic scene layouts (i.e., stage 1 of LVD) or provide the boxes for each frame. Check out the [example colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17He4bFAF8lXmT9Nfv-Sg29iKtPelDUNZ).

### Text-to-image generation
The pretrained adapters for text-to-video generation on SDv2.1 can be found here: [https://huggingface.co/longlian/igligen-sd2.1-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/longlian/igligen-sd2.1-v1.0). The models trained with this repo is compatible with the official pipeline for inference (`StableDiffusionGLIGENPipeline`) on SDv1.5 and SDv2.1. You can use it in LMD+, as currently GLIGEN only offers weights for SDv1.4. Check out the [example colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vl3Y2gZcjmXBh7fdDUMF9v-rrQZBXUD7).

  <summary>An example that uses SD v2.1 + GLIGEN.</summary>

## Dataset Download and Preprocessing
**Note: we have preprocessed the dataset and uploaded them to huggingface. See [Download Preprocessed Dataset](#download-preprocessed-dataset) for details. You only need to download the raw dataset if you want to preprocess them on your own.**

[GLIGEN](https://github.com/gligen/GLIGEN) uses a mix of multiple datasets in training, with text/image embeddings coded in the tsv files. The preprocessing code (how to turn a dataset into the tsv files) is not given, which makes it hard to adapt to custom datasets. The text embeddings are different for different diffusion models, which make the stored embeddings in the tsv files not useful. The dataset is thus not efficiently stored.

This project takes another route. Similar to PixArt-alpha, we use [SA-1B](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything/) dataset for training. Note that SA-1B dataset actually has ~11M images. If you use the code/weights from this project, you agree to adhere to the [terms and conditions](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/) of SA-1B.

We provide complete preprocessing scripts, so you can easily switch to other datasets on your own.

We also have an implementation that takes in the tsv files of GLIGEN. However, it's not as efficient, and the dataloader part is more complicated. Therefore, it's not added to this repo. If you would like to get the code for this variant, you can create an issue.

### Download Raw Dataset
**Note: See [Download Preprocessed Dataset](#download-preprocessed-dataset) for preprocessed dataset.**

Please download the tar files from the [SA-1B website](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/). Captions of images of SA-1B are from LLaVA, generated by PixArt-alpha team, you can download them here [SAM-LLaVA-captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PixArt-alpha/SAM-LLaVA-Captions10M).

### Dataset Preprocessing
We use [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) to obtain the boxes. The [script](preprocess/extract_sa-1b_boxes.py) is in `preprocessing` directory. Please update the paths to SAM-LLaVA-captions. You probably need to clone GroundingDINO and put the script inside. Please refer to the [GroundingDINO repo](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) for GroundingDINO config and weights.

We also preprocess the dataset into latents so that it does not have to be encoded again in training. This also saves a lot of space. Note that you need to preprocess the dataset for the desired resolution (e.g., SDv1.4/1.5/2.1-base use 512x512, while ModelScope uses 256x256). The [script](preprocess/encode_latents.py) is in `preprocessing` directory.

You can use `xargs` command to parallelize preprocessing:
```shell
ls -1 /path_to_sa-1b/sa_000{000..999}.tar|sort|xargs -P 2 -I {} python extract_sa-1b_boxes.py {}
ls -1 /path_to_sa-1b/sa_000{000..999}.tar|sort|xargs -P 2 -I {} python encode_latents.py {}
```

### Download Preprocessed Dataset
The dataset is preprocessed and stored in latent format. The preprocessed dataset is much smaller than the original dataset, thanks to the efficient latent space. As an example, SA-1B tar files are typically around 11GB. However, after preprocessing, each npy file corresponding to a tar file is around 368MB (resolution is 512x512). Only the preprocessed dataset is used in training.

| Preprocessed SA-1B | HuggingFace Link |
| -------- | ------- |
| Latents (512x512, for SD v1.4/1.5/2.1-base)  | https://huggingface.co/datasets/longlian/sa-1b_latents_512 |
| Latents (256x256, for ModelScope) | https://huggingface.co/datasets/longlian/sa-1b_latents_256 |
| Latents (768, for SD v2.1)  | https://huggingface.co/datasets/longlian/sa-1b_latents_768 |
| Bounding Boxes    | https://huggingface.co/datasets/longlian/sa-1b_boxes |

Please put the latents in `data/latents` and bounding boxes in `data/boxes`.

## Training
Training with 4 GPUs with SD v2.1:

```shell
sh train_sdv2.1.sh
```

You can edit the training script to use more/fewer GPUs and update the hyperparameters.

The training time for 500k steps is roughtly 3.75 days on 4x A6000 with image resolution 512x512 on SDv2.1.
